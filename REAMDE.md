## Project Abstract
- The project is a sales predictor that utilizes time forecasting to predict the sales of a product given a particular date
- The dataset currently consists of grocery sales for regions in Tamil Nadu, India. However users can select which datasets they would like to perform time forecasting on given it follows the necessary format as specified below
- For this reason the project structure has been segmented off into folders based on the data on which the predictions/data analysis is being done to ensure organized structure and segmentation based on which data is being processed
## Forecasting and Prediction Method
- The program uses time forecasting method by leveraging the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model alongside depersonalization of trends of the original data to predict the sales of a product on a given date
- This model works best when it has a few years worth of data to predict seasonal trends as well. In the event seasonal data is not available, the program will simply use a moving average model to predict the sales
